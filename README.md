# Data structures & Algorithm

![dsa](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110188033/193694645-1fdbda35-db52-422e-81ba-30284c612baf.png)

This Repo provide a practical implementation of basic datastructures and algorithm 
such as Linked list, Stack, Queues and many more. We start with the implementation of Singly LinkedList, the pattern that will 
follow is that the data structure and algorithm implemented will be in two forms:

1. Data structure and Algorithm will be implemented using a particular builtin datatype and
2. Data structure and Algorithm will be implemented using generic in which you can use it
  on what ever type of object you wish.
